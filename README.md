# 🎄 Party Voucher Website

A small side project I made with Cursor for a family gift. Nothing too serious—just an interactive voucher page with music, animations, and a bit of confetti.
If it inspires your own version, feel free to fork it and make it your own.

## 🚀 Features

- **Interactive Landing Page**: Shaking gift icon that triggers confetti
- **Background Music**: Continuous Christmas music with play/pause toggle
- **Falling Snow Animation**: Continuous snow effect on all pages
- **Form Validation**: Date picker restricted to December 25th and later
- **Google Calendar Integration**: Automatic calendar invite creation
- **Smooth Page Transitions**: Music continues seamlessly between pages
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## 🛠️ Setup

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Make sure all files are in the correct folder structure
3. For best results, use a local server:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
   Then visit `http://localhost:8000/pages/index.html`
   
   Or simply: `http://localhost:8000/pages/`

## 📝 Notes

- The form uses Netlify form handling (data-netlify="true")
- Music playback requires user interaction (clicking the gift)
- Calendar invite includes my email as an attendee
- All paths are relative, so the folder structure must be maintained

## 🎨 Customization

- Replace `assets/your-gif.gif` with your own GIF
- Replace `assets/jingle-bell-rock.mp3` with your own music file
- Update email in `js/success.js` (line 46) for calendar invites
- Modify colors and styles in `css/style.css`
